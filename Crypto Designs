1) On each transaction, charge an additional 1% to be put in a pot for charity, 0.5% going to a community lottery pot,
every time ask if the user wants to donate an additional amount then they get an additional stake in the pot for charity
2) Be able to borrow (with interest rate) a certain amount of money with a time sensitive time period to pay back, interest goes into the charity pot 
3) If you burn money, 20% of the burned money goes into the community lottery pot or the charity pot depending on the amount (<certain amount -> charity)
